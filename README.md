# Computer-Vision---Object-Tracking-with-OpenCV-and-Python
 It is a project-based course, I learnt how to implement Computer Vision Object Tracking to videos and real time videos. At the end of the project, I got a overall idea of how Optical and Dense Optical Flow work, how to use MeanShift and CamShift and how to do a Single and a Multi-Object Tracking.
